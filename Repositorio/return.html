	One of the principles of <i>structured programming</i> states that programs should have a single entry point and one exit point. Furthermore, enlanzado with the previous council, a return can be considered a GOTO towards the end of the function. The use of a single return to function, consequently placed at the end of it, both <b>provide clearance as the adaptability of programs.</b>

	For example, if you are debugging a program and want to know which function returns a value, if any one return, or simply print the return before invoking this return value; or put a breakpoint in that judgment. If instead we had, say, five return statements in the function, we would have to place and manage five breakpoints while debugging the program.
