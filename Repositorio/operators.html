	Try to avoid using the unary operators ++ and --. Depending on its use, subtle errors may occur. For example

	Unary operators should not be separated from their single operand. Generally, all binary operators except '.' and '->' should be separated from their operands by blanks. Some judgement is called for in the case of complex expressions, which may be clearer if the "inner" operators are not surrounded by spaces and the "outer" ones are.

	<p>
	When writing expressions containing many operators, see the table of precedence
	operators . Confirm that the expression operators are executed in the order
	wait. If you are unsure of the order of evaluation of a complex expression, place
	parentheses to force the order, just as you would in an algebraic expression.

	Also, note that some operators, such as assignment (=), right to associate
	left, not left to right.
