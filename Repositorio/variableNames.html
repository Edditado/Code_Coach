Use meaningful names for your variables. The goal is to get that code reading be "self-explanatory", which facilitates further editing and understanding. For example:
</p><br>
 	<center> <img src="varnames.jpg" width="500" height="150"></center>
 </li>

<li>
 	<p>You can abbreviate a word instead of putting it complete, but it should be clear
its meaning.
</p> <br>
 	
 </li>
 <li>
 	<p>The variables to be used as indices for iteration usually start
from i. That is, i, j, k.. etc.
</p> <br>
 	
 </li>

<li>
 	<p>
The variable name n is frequently used as a user-entered data
and is a parameter of the problem. Other parameters are from m
onwards.

Variable names are usually written in lowercase.
