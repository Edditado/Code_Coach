	<p>
	Unreachable Code is part of the source code of a program which can never be executed because there exists no control flow path to the code from the rest of the program. For example
	</p><br> 
	<center> <img src="unreachable.jpg" width="300" height="100"></center><br>
	
 </li>

	<p>
Unreachable code is generally considered undesirable for a number of reasons, including:
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Occupies unnecessary memory.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Causes unnecessary caching of instructions into the CPU instruction cache - which also decreases data locality.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* From the perspective of program maintenance; time and effort may be spent maintaining and documenting a piece of code which is in fact unreachable, hence never executed.</p>
