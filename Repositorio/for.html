	<p>
	In a control structure For use initialization sections and increase only for actions related to the control variable. For example
	</p><br> 
	<center> <img src="for.jpg" width="450" height="150"></center>
	
 </li>
 <br>
<li>
	<p>
	Manipulations of other variables should appear before the cycle (if only run once, as the initialization) or in the body of the loop (if they execute once a repetition, as in the case of increment or decrement instructions)
	</p>
 </li>
 <li>
 	<p>
 	Although the value of the control variable can be changed in the body of the for loop, avoid doing so, as this practice can lead to subtle logic errors.
