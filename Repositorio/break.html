	Avoid using sentences to break the sequential execution flow of a program is the basic principle of structured programming. The type <b>goto</b> statements hinder readability, debug and program verfication by allowing the implementation of a program to perform arbitrary jumps. Those functions that make use of goto statements are much harder to reuse and debugging

	The use of <b>break</b> and <b>continue</b> statements usually associated with artisanal construction techniques loops where a loop is first encoded and then checks its correction by trial and error using debugging.Not using to use these statements usually requires thinking first or invariant condition must be fulfilled during the execution of the loop, and the loop and then encode. This second technique is much more engineering is the basis for subsequent formal verification of the loop and often contributes to improve readability of programs.

	For example: 
	In a loop break free <b>while</b> sentences, we know that the loop ends when the condition no longer applies.Therefore, to know if a loop end, simply check that the loop body converges to some computation that such a condition is realized. Furthermore, in the absence of break statements at the exit of the loop we know that the denial of the loop condition will always be a real predicate, which is the basis for further designing the program.
